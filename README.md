## Array

An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type. The length of an array is established when the array is created.<br>
After creation, its length is fixed. You have seen an example of arrays already, in the main method of the "Hello World!" application.<br>

Each item in an array is called an element, and each element is accessed by its numerical index.<br>
As shown in the preceding illustration, numbering begins with 0. The 9th element, for example, would therefore be accessed at index 8.
